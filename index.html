        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        <p class="info-box">
         My name is Mustafa Ibrahim and I am currently a rising third year student majoring in Electrical Engineering. I spent my first two years at the University of California, Riverside. I enjoyed my time there but when UCLA came knocking, I knew there was no turning back! Some hobbies that I have are listening to music, playing video games, hanging out with friends/family, etc. I strive to learn something new everyday and to help others achieve their goals.
